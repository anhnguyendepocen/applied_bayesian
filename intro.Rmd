## Intro

* Jags another Gibbs Sampler
* Clone of Bugs
* BUGS (Baysian inference Using Gibbs Sampling): 
    1. Baysian Inference
    2. raphical modeling
    3. simulation-based inference 
* object-based  interface (rjags)
* rjags returns a dynamic model and we can draw samples from this model. 
* Bugs is inspired by S
* for loop sin bugs are a macro expensions of single line codes (no controll flow statement) 

* rjags: set up model;
* r2jags: set up, burn in and sample. 
* runjags: long burn in phase 4000
